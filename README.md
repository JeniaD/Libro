# LIBRO PROJECT

LIBRO is an innovative web solution designed to streamline and simplify the process of managing and searching through your databases. With its comprehensive functionality, LIBRO enables users to conveniently upload, store, delete, and search these databases effortlessly.

The core idea behind LIBRO is to centralize the management of multiple (preferably, .csv) leaked databases in a single platform. This way, you can quickly access and analyze valuable data from various sources using simple queries. Whether it's credentials, personal information, or other sensitive details, LIBRO ensures that all this information remains easily accessible whenever needed.

One of LIBRO's key features is its powerful search functionality. By simply entering a person's name, email address, or phone number, you can efficiently retrieve relevant information from all the uploaded databases in a matter of seconds. This comprehensive search functionality allows you to quickly draw connections and uncover critical insights about individuals or entities of interest.

LIBRO's intuitive interface enables users to effortlessly navigate through its features. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible for people with varying levels of technical expertise, ensuring that anyone can leverage its capabilities effectively.
